# Py Image Editor TODO list

## TODO

- Fix initial slider issues (when editing the value, it automatically sets it to the slider value, not the original image one).
- More options to enhance image.
- Add spaces between sliders and buttons, original image and button.
- Write last file path to another directory.
- Add an option to remove background.
- Rename ImageProcessor to FileProcessor.

## DONE

- Improve UX by providing labels to each slider.
- Anti-fool system: if I forget to pass geometry parameter, app shall replace it by itself.
- Fix performance issues while working with 4k+ images.
- Add auto image resize for large images.
