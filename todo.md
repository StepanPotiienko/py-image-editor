# Py Image Editor TODO list

## TODO

* Fix initial slider issues (when editing the value, it automatically sets it to the slider value, not the original image one).
* More options to enhance image.
* Fix performance issues while working with 4k+ images.
* Add spaces between sliders and buttons, original image and button.
* Add auto image resize for large images.
* Write last file path to another directory.
* Add an option to remove background.
* Rename ImageProcessor to FileProcessor.

## DONE

* Improve UX by providing labels to each slider.
* Anti-fool system: if I forget to pass geometry parameter, app shall replace it by itself.
